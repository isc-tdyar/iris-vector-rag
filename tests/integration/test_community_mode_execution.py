Integration tests for Community Edition backend mode execution.

These tests verify:
- Community mode prevents license pool exhaustion (NFR-002)
- Connection limits are enforced (FR-003, FR-011)
- Sequential execution works correctly (FR-004)

Requires: Live IRIS Community Edition database
Status: Tests MUST FAIL until Phase 3.3 implementation
