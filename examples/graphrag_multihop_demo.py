                Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels.
                Common symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, and blurred vision.
                The primary cause is insulin resistance, where cells don't respond properly to insulin.
                Risk factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history, and age over 45.
                
                Treatment typically involves lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and healthy diet.
                Medications like metformin are often prescribed as first-line therapy for blood sugar control.
                In advanced cases, insulin therapy may be necessary. Complications can include cardiovascular disease,
                kidney damage, nerve damage, and diabetic retinopathy affecting the eyes.

                Hypertension and diabetes frequently coexist, creating a dangerous combination that significantly
                increases cardiovascular risk. Both conditions share common risk factors including obesity and
                metabolic syndrome. High blood pressure damages blood vessels, while diabetes affects the same
                vascular system through glucose-induced oxidative stress.
                
                ACE inhibitors and ARBs (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers) are preferred antihypertensive medications
                in diabetic patients because they provide additional kidney protection. Lisinopril and losartan
                are commonly prescribed. Blood pressure targets are more stringent in diabetic patients, typically
                below 130/80 mmHg. The combination requires careful monitoring and often multiple medications.

                Metformin is the most widely prescribed medication for type 2 diabetes and works through several
                mechanisms. It primarily reduces hepatic glucose production by inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver.
                Additionally, it improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, particularly muscle tissue.
                
                Recent research suggests metformin also has anti-inflammatory properties and may reduce cancer risk.
                Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, particularly when starting treatment. The medication
                is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney disease due to risk of lactic acidosis. Metformin
                is often combined with other diabetes medications like sulfonylureas or SGLT-2 inhibitors for better
                glycemic control.

                Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized oncology treatment by harnessing the body's immune system

                block PD-1 receptors, allowing T-cells to attack cancer more effectively.
                
                These medications have shown remarkable success in treating various cancers including melanoma,
                lung cancer, and kidney cancer. However, they can cause immune-related adverse events affecting
                multiple organ systems. Patients may develop autoimmune-like conditions affecting the thyroid,

                Diabetic nephropathy is a serious complication of diabetes affecting approximately 30% of patients
                with type 1 diabetes and 40% of those with type 2 diabetes. High blood glucose levels damage the
                small blood vessels in the kidneys over time, leading to protein leakage and eventual kidney failure.
                
                Early detection involves monitoring albumin levels in urine and serum creatinine. ACE inhibitors
                and ARBs are the gold standard for kidney protection in diabetic patients. SGLT-2 inhibitors like
                empagliflozin have also shown kidney-protective benefits. In advanced cases, dialysis or kidney
                transplantation may be necessary. Prevention focuses on tight glucose and blood pressure control.

                COVID-19 poses increased risks for patients with diabetes, who have higher rates of severe illness

                Inflammation from COVID-19 can increase insulin resistance, making diabetes management more challenging.
                
                Long COVID symptoms have been reported to include new-onset diabetes in some patients, suggesting
                the virus may damage pancreatic beta cells. Vaccination is strongly recommended for all diabetic
                patients. During illness, more frequent blood sugar monitoring is essential, and some patients may
                need temporary insulin therapy even if they normally don't require it.

                Statins are widely prescribed for cardiovascular risk reduction, particularly important in diabetic
                patients who have elevated cardiovascular risk. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are commonly used
                statins that effectively lower LDL cholesterol. However, statins can slightly increase blood glucose
                levels and may contribute to new-onset diabetes in predisposed individuals.
                
                Despite this risk, the cardiovascular benefits of statins in diabetic patients far outweigh the
                glucose-related concerns. The risk of developing diabetes is small compared to the significant
                reduction in heart attacks and strokes. Regular monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when
                starting statin therapy in patients with risk factors for diabetes.
