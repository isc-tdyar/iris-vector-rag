RAGAS Evaluation Script for Merged GraphRAG Implementation

This script evaluates the merged GraphRAG implementation using RAGAS metrics
against PMC sample queries with ground truth, comparing performance with
current GraphRAG and BasicRAG implementations.

RAGAS Metrics Evaluated:
1. Answer Correctness - Accuracy of the generated answer
2. Faithfulness - Whether the answer is grounded in retrieved context
3. Context Precision - Relevance of retrieved context chunks
4. Context Recall - Coverage of relevant information in context
5. Answer Relevance - Relevance of answer to the query

Target: >80% accuracy across all metrics

                Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and progressive 
                beta-cell dysfunction. The pathophysiology involves multiple mechanisms: impaired 
                insulin signaling in peripheral tissues, increased hepatic glucose production, 
                and decreased glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissue.
                
                Insulin resistance begins with post-receptor defects in the insulin signaling 
                cascade, particularly involving insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and 
                phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. This leads to reduced glucose 
                transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the cell membrane.
                
                Beta-cell dysfunction manifests as reduced insulin secretion in response to 
                glucose, loss of first-phase insulin release, and eventual beta-cell apoptosis. 
                Contributing factors include glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, inflammatory cytokines, 
                and amyloid deposition.

                Metformin is a biguanide antidiabetic medication that works primarily by activating 
                AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The drug inhibits mitochondrial respiratory 
                chain complex I, leading to increased AMP/ATP ratio and subsequent AMPK activation.
                
                The primary therapeutic effects include: reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis through 
                inhibition of gluconeogenic enzymes, increased peripheral glucose uptake in skeletal 
                muscle, and improved insulin sensitivity. Metformin also decreases intestinal glucose 
                absorption and may have beneficial effects on lipid metabolism.
                
                Clinical efficacy shows HbA1c reduction of 1.0-1.5% when used as monotherapy. 
                The drug has a favorable safety profile with gastrointestinal side effects being 
                most common. Contraindications include severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m²) 
                due to increased risk of lactic acidosis.

                Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes

                and advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation.
                
                Key mechanisms include: endothelial nitric oxide synthase dysfunction, increased 
                inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α), altered platelet function, and dyslipidemia. 
                The combination creates a pro-atherogenic and pro-thrombotic environment.

                COVID-19 infection significantly impacts patients with diabetes mellitus, leading

                causing new-onset diabetes.
                
                Mechanisms for increased severity include: compromised immune function, higher 
                expression of ACE2 receptors, chronic inflammatory state, and increased risk of 
                thrombotic complications. COVID-19 can also directly damage pancreatic beta cells 
                through ACE2 receptor binding.
                
                Management considerations include: more frequent glucose monitoring, potential need 
                for insulin therapy even in non-insulin dependent patients, telemedicine utilization, 
                and prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination. Metformin should be temporarily

                Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors represent a novel class of

                Beyond glycemic benefits, SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrate cardiovascular and renal
