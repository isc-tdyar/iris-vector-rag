                Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia 
                resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic 
                hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure 
                of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.
                
                Risk factors include obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²), sedentary lifestyle, family history of 
                diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg), HDL cholesterol 
                <35 mg/dL, triglyceride level ≥250 mg/dL, and previously identified impaired glucose 
                tolerance or impaired fasting glucose.
                
                Pathophysiology involves insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (muscle, liver, 
                adipose tissue) combined with progressive beta-cell dysfunction and failure. The liver 
                shows increased glucose production via gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, while muscle 
                tissue demonstrates decreased glucose uptake.

                Metformin, a biguanide derivative, is the first-line oral antidiabetic medication for 
                type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its primary mechanism of action involves the activation of 
                AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes, leading to reduced gluconeogenesis 
                and increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.
                
                Molecular mechanisms include: (1) Inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, 
                reducing ATP synthesis and increasing AMP/ATP ratio; (2) Activation of liver kinase B1 
                (LKB1) and subsequently AMPK; (3) Phosphorylation and inactivation of acetyl-CoA 
                carboxylase (ACC); (4) Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and promotion of fatty acid 
                oxidation.
                
                Clinical efficacy demonstrates HbA1c reduction of 1.0-1.5% when used as monotherapy.

                Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide, 
                affecting approximately 20-40% of patients with diabetes mellitus. The pathogenesis 
                involves multiple interconnected pathways including advanced glycation end products 
                (AGEs), protein kinase C (PKC) activation, polyol pathway flux, and hexosamine pathway 
                activation.
                
                Early pathological changes include glomerular hyperfiltration, mesangial expansion, 
                thickening of glomerular and tubular basement membranes, and podocyte loss. Progressive 
                changes lead to glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and ultimately nephron 
                loss. Key biomarkers include microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24h), elevated serum creatinine, 
                and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate.
                
                Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) 
                represent gold standard therapy, providing both blood pressure control and renoprotective 
                effects through reduction of intraglomerular pressure and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. 
                SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin, canagliflozin) demonstrate additional renoprotective 
                benefits independent of glycemic control.

                Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients 
                with diabetes mellitus, with a 2-4 fold increased risk compared to non-diabetic individuals. 
                The pathophysiology involves accelerated atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, 
                increased platelet aggregation, and altered lipid metabolism.
                
                Hyperglycemia promotes oxidative stress through increased production of reactive oxygen 
                species (ROS), leading to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and reduced 
                nitric oxide bioavailability. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in vessel 
                walls, promoting inflammation and collagen cross-linking.
                
                Lipid management targets include LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dL for high-risk patients, with 
                statins as first-line therapy. High-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40-80 mg, rosuvastatin 
                20-40 mg) demonstrate significant cardiovascular risk reduction. Dual antiplatelet therapy 
                may be considered in high-risk patients without bleeding contraindications.
                
                Novel therapies include GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide) and SGLT-2 
                inhibitors, which demonstrate cardiovascular benefits beyond glycemic control through 
                mechanisms including weight reduction, blood pressure lowering, and direct cardioprotective 
                effects.

                The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the bidirectional relationship between SARS-CoV-2 
                infection and diabetes mellitus. Patients with diabetes face increased risk of severe 
                COVID-19, including higher rates of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and mortality.
                
                Proposed mechanisms for increased severity include: (1) Chronic inflammation and 
                immunosuppression associated with diabetes; (2) Higher ACE2 receptor expression in 
                diabetic patients; (3) Impaired neutrophil function and delayed viral clearance; 
                (4) Increased risk of thrombotic complications due to hypercoagulable state.
                
                COVID-19 can also induce new-onset diabetes through direct pancreatic beta-cell damage 
                via ACE2 receptors, systemic inflammation, and corticosteroid treatment effects. Studies 
                report 14-47% incidence of new hyperglycemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
                
                Management considerations include: intensive glucose monitoring, potential need for 
                insulin therapy even in non-insulin dependent patients, telemedicine for diabetes care 
                continuity, and prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination. Metformin should be discontinued

                Insulin resistance is a pathophysiological condition characterized by diminished 
                responsiveness of target tissues to physiological levels of insulin. It represents 
                the primary defect underlying type 2 diabetes mellitus and is central to metabolic 
                syndrome pathogenesis.
                
                Molecular mechanisms involve defects in insulin signaling cascade, including: 
                (1) Insulin receptor substrate (IRS) protein phosphorylation abnormalities; 
                (2) Reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity; (3) Impaired glucose 
                transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation; (4) Altered protein kinase B (Akt) 
                phosphorylation patterns.
                
                Adipose tissue dysfunction plays a crucial role through altered adipokine secretion. 
                Decreased adiponectin and increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 
                (IL-6), and resistin contribute to systemic insulin resistance. Free fatty acid 
                release from dysfunctional adipocytes promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis and muscle 
                insulin resistance.
                
                Assessment methods include homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance 
                (HOMA-IR), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (gold standard), and oral glucose 
                tolerance testing. Therapeutic approaches target multiple pathways including 
                insulin sensitizers, weight management, and exercise interventions.
