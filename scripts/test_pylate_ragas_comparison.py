PyLate ColBERT RAGAS Evaluation - Pipeline Comparison

This script evaluates the PyLate ColBERT pipeline using RAGAS metrics and compares
it against BasicRAG, BasicRAGReranking, CRAG, and GraphRAG pipelines.

RAGAS Metrics:
- Answer Relevancy: How relevant is the generated answer to the query?
- Faithfulness: Is the answer grounded in the retrieved context?
- Context Precision: How precise are the retrieved contexts?
- Context Recall: How well do contexts cover the ground truth?
